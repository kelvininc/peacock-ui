1.Definitions.

1.1 “Application” means a software application or control application developed by Developer utilizing the Kelvin SDK for use with the Kelvin Solution.

1.2 “Kelvin Software Development Kit” or “Kelvin SDK” means Kelvin’s proprietary software development kit which includes application programming interfaces (“APIs”), headers, files, libraries, templates or other sample code and other tools and documentation included in the attached Kelvin SDK package and made available to assist Developer in the creation of Applications.

2.License Rights.

2.1 SDK License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Kelvin grants to Developer a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, revocable license to (i) use the Kelvin SDK solely to develop and test Application(s) to interoperate with the Kelvin Solution; and (ii) modify, reproduce and create derivative works of the models, algorithms, templates or other sample source code included in the Kelvin SDK in whole or in part and include the binary code of such modifications in such Application(s). Applications which are derived from any code or components included with the Kelvin SDK may only be used by authorized licensees of the Kelvin Solution. Each Application is subject to Kelvin’s review and certification. In Kelvin’s sole discretion, as further described in Section 3 below. If Developer is a commercial customer of the Kelvin Solution (or a third party contractor developing Applications solely on behalf of a single commercial customer of the Kelvin Solution), Developer may use the certified Applications (or provide such Applications for such customer’s use) with the Kelvin Solution in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the customer’s separate commercial agreement with Kelvin. Except for the foregoing, Developer will have no right to license, distribute or otherwise transfer the Kelvin SDK or derivatives incorporating any components of the Kelvin SDK to any third parties, unless otherwise expressly authorized by Kelvin in a Distribution Agreement as further described in Section 2.4 below.

2.2 Test Accounts. To assist Developer in creating Applications, may request in writing, and Kelvin may on a case-by-case basis and in its sole discretion authorize Developer limited access to non-production, online test account(s) for the Kelvin Solution to use as reasonably necessary to develop and test the Application(s) to interoperate with the Kelvin Solution (“Test Account”). Use of test accounts for development activities may be subject to an additional fee. Developer may only use simulation or historical data when evaluating Applications in the Kelvin Test Account and will not upload any personal information or live data gathered from actual assets or the production or commercial environments of Developer, its customers or any of other third party. If Kelvin elects to authorize Developer access to a Kelvin Test Account, Kelvin will provide certain account information to enable Developer to access the Test Account and Developer shall be responsible for all actions of any users accessing such Test Account. Developer acknowledges and agrees that all use of the Test Account(s) is subject to the terms of this Agreement. Developer will have no right to use any Test Account for Developer’s or any of its customers’ or other third party’s regular business operations.

2.3 Third Party Materials. Developer acknowledges that use, reproduction and distribution of certain third party materials included in the Kelvin SDK may be subject to other terms and conditions found in separate third party license agreements or “READ ME” files included with the applicable third party materials. Some of these additional third party materials may include open source components licensed under an open source software license. All third party materials, including open source components are governed solely by the terms of the applicable third party licenses and not this Agreement.

2.4 Distribution Rights. Except for the case where is developing an Application on behalf of a single commercial customer of the Kelvin Solution as described in Section 2.1, Developer acknowledges it may only distribute an Application after (i) Developer and Kelvin have mutually executed a separate Application Distribution Agreement (“Distribution Agreement”) for the Application, and (ii) Kelvin reviews and certifies the Application in accordance with Section 3 below. The Distribution Agreement will describe the scope of Developer’s authorized distribution of a particular Application, any fees to be paid by Developer to Kelvin, and other terms and conditions relating to the distribution of such Application.

2.5 Restrictions. Developer agrees that Developer will not and will not attempt to: (a) distribute, sell, resell, share, lease, sublease, assign, or otherwise transfer the Kelvin SDK; (b) disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer any part of the object code components of the Kelvin SDK or attempt to discover any source code or underlying ideas, structure, organizations or algorithms of the Kelvin Solution; © remove, modify or otherwise tamper with notices or legends on the Kelvin SDK or otherwise remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices associated with the Kelvin Solution; (d) design Application(s) to alter or interfere with the normal operation, behavior, functionality or performance of the Kelvin Solution or hardware devices interacting with the Kelvin Solution; (e) transmit malicious code to the Kelvin Solution or disrupt the integrity of third party data contained in the Kelvin Solution; or (f) use an Application to store or transmit material in violation of third party Intellectual Property Rights or applicable privacy laws to the Kelvin Solution. Developer agrees that the Applications, Kelvin SDK, Test Account and Kelvin Solution shall not be used by Developer for any unlawful purpose or otherwise in violation of any applicable law or regulation. Kelvin reserves the right, without limiting any other right or remedy, to immediately suspend Developer’s access to and use of any Test Account and/or terminate SE’s right to use the Kelvin SDK for cause if Kelvin determines in good faith that Developer is engaging (or has engaged) in any of the activities prohibited under this Section 2.5.

3.Review and Certification.

3.1 Review of Applications. Developer acknowledges that proper interoperation of the Application with the Kelvin Solution is necessary to ensure a good user experience. Upon Developer’s completion of development of the Application, Developer shall notify Kelvin that the Application is ready for Kelvin to review. Developer will deliver to or provide Kelvin with reasonable access to the Application and any related Developer or third party services necessary to enable Kelvin to test the Application in a test environment designated by Kelvin for the purpose of confirming that the Application and Kelvin Solution interoperate as intended. Developer grants Kelvin the right to use the Application and related services for testing and verification purposes and to review, inspect and test the interoperability and functional calls made between the Application and the Kelvin Solution for the purpose of testing the Application, and supporting and maintaining the proper functionality of the Kelvin Solution. Upon completion of such testing, Kelvin will notify Developer if the tests are successful or if any issues with the interoperability are identified. If any issues are identified during the testing, Developer may continue development of the Application to remedy such issues and may resubmit the Application for testing once such issues are resolved. Developer will also comply with any other certification requirements specified by Kelvin.

3.2 Certification. Upon receipt of written notice that testing is successful and all certification program requirements have been met, Developer and Kelvin may, but are not obligated to agree to the terms of a Distribution Agreement that would authorize Developer to use and distribute the Application in accordance with the terms of such Distribution Agreement. Developer shall not use or permit any customer or other third party to use an Application until such Application has been approved and certified by Kelvin. Developer acknowledges and agrees not to in any way express or imply that an Application or Kelvin’s certification of such is an endorsement of such Application.

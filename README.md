# Kelvin UI Components

Kelvin UI Components provides a set of reusable, high quality framework-agnostic UI components, which means you can use them with the current most popular Front-End Development Frameworks like React, Angular or if you prefer the components are also available as W3C compliant WebComponents.

However, this is not just a library of UI components as it's also a style guide where you can see how the component looks and behaves by interacting with it, for this we use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a free open-source tool.

Our Storybook is publicly available [here]()
